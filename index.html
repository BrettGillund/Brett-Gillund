            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my portfolio! Below you will find a number of my projects, and desriptions of the languages used in them. Please feel free to reach out using the contact information tab.</p>
            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>  
                Upon graduating from the University of North Dakota, I started my own medical device distributorship business selling a line of radiation production devices to hospitals and surgical centers 
                around the Minneapolis area. Due to the business not performing to the level I had wished, I decided to close shop and find a more stable career in a corporate setting. This is how I was introduced 
                to my next career in corporate sales with Donaldson Company located in Bloomington, Minnesota. Unfortunatley, a little later then a year after my start with Donaldson I was let go due to a restructring 
                withing the organization. Following this I worked breifly in Customer Account Management with 3M, and it was through meeting the wonderful web development team that I decided to start a new carrer. Now 
                I am only just a few weeks into a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, and I am sure that this is where I am supposed to be.
